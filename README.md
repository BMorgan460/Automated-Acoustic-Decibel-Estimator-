Coverts Counts to Decibels
Run the CountConversion.jar file
Either direct values or a file
Direct conversion needs the counts and frequency and will return decibels
Amplifier gain can also be selected between "Large" and "Small" array
Large Arrays are 
Small Arrays are anything else
File conversion requires these to be specified in the file in the order of:
  Channel, Date (unnecesary), Time (unnecesary), Frequency, Power/Counts
The File conversion also should also not have any labels
The File should also be a .csv file
